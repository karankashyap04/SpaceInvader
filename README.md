# SpaceInvader

This was a project in which I started to learn the basics of game development using the framework PyGame.
The code here is based off a beginners PyGame tutorial shared by FreeCodeCamp, which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/FfWpgLFMI7w).

Since this was the first time I was using PyGame, I added many comments to my code (to help me remember the logic and syntax), as a result of which it does not look that clean. Subsequent projects I work on using PyGame will definitely look cleaner and have more efficiently designed code.
